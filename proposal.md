# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

MoodWeb

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that keeps a record of a person's quality of sleep, amount of food eaten, stress levels, and moods, all inputted by the person daily.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will be using Django to help with the web application in order to focus mostly on Python, and I will input user authentication. The mood tracker will have different colors for each mood, and will display the full list of colors when set to day view, and will expand that if user inputs week view or month view. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be for me to finish the project just in time and get at least 3/4 functions that I want to input.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can accomplish the full list of features, it would just take a lot of studying more python methods and some html.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be if I finished the project at least a few days before the deadline, so that I can have some time to revise it.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will acquire new skills of learning at least basic html, and figuring out how to program user authentication. Also, I need to figure how to even install Django in my library, I have no base of coding before this class so I had to research the different databases I would need to use in order to achieve these, like SQLite.
